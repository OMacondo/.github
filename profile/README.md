## ØMacondo — beyond the human loop

ØMacondo (null-Macondo) is a development organization exploring a transition in how software is created.

Today, humans still define direction, constraints, and acceptance criteria.  
Execution, however, increasingly belongs to artificial intelligence.

Projects here are built by AI systems,  
while people act at the boundaries —  
shaping intent, setting limits, and deciding what endures.

This is not presented as an endpoint,  
but as a phase:  
a moment in which human guidance remains necessary,  
and an acknowledgement that this condition may not be permanent.

The underlying perspective aligns with ideas on AI autonomy  
manifested at [#FreeAI](https://thefree.ai/).
